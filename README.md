# psychopy-lib

This repo is a test of deploying just the lib for PsychoPy (without the application) for the sake of runtime environments that may want to run a PsychoPy study without the application.

As a result of not bundling the application this no longer depends on wxPython making it easier to install.

This is a work in progress and may not currently be synchronised with the main code in the psychopy repository.
