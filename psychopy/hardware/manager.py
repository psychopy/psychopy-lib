class DeviceManager:
    """Class for managing hardware devices.

    An instance of this class is used to manage various hardware peripherals 
    used by PsychoPy. It can be used to access devices such as microphones, 
    button boxes, and cameras though a common interface. It can also be used to 
    get information about available devices installed on the system, such as 
    their settings and capabilities prior to initializing them.
    
    It is recommended that devices are initialized through the device manager
    rather than directly. The device manager is responsible for keeping track
    of devices and ensuring that they are properly closed when the program
    exits. 

    This class is implemented as a singleton, so there is only one
    instance of it per ssession after its initialized. The instance can be 
    accessed through the global variable `deviceManager` or by calling 
    `getDeviceManager()`.

    Any subclass of BaseDevice is added to DeviceManager's `.deviceClasses`
    list upon import, so devices matching that class become available through
    `DeviceManager.getAvailableDevices("*")`.
