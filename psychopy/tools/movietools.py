class MovieFileWriter:
    """Create movies from a sequence of images.

    This class allows for the creation of movies from a sequence of images using
    FFMPEG (via the `ffpyplayer` or `cv2` libraries). Writing movies to disk is 
    a slow process, so this class uses a separate thread to write the movie in 
    the background. This means that you can continue to add images to the movie 
    while frames are still being written to disk. Movie writers are closed 
    automatically when the main thread exits. Any remaining frames are flushed 
    to the file before the file is finalized.

    Writing audio tracks is not supported. If you need to add audio to your 
    movie, create the movie first, then add the audio track to the file. The
    :func:`addAudioToMovie` function can be used to do this after the video and
    audio files have been saved to disk.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        The name (or path) of the file to write the movie to. The file extension
        determines the movie format.
    size : tuple or str
        The size of the movie in pixels (width, height). If a string is passed,
        it should be one of the keys in the `VIDEO_RESOLUTIONS` dictionary.
    fps : float
        The number of frames per second.
    codec : str or None
        The codec to use for encoding the movie. This may be a codec identifier
        (e.g., 'libx264') or a FourCC code. The value depends of the 
        `encoderLib` in use. If `None`, the a codec determined by the file 
        extension will be used.
    pixelFormat : str
        Pixel format for frames being added to the movie. This should be 
        either 'rgb24' or 'rgba32'. The default is 'rgb24'. When passing frames
        to `addFrame()` as a numpy array, the array should be in the format
        specified here.
    encoderLib : str
        The library to use to handle encoding and writing the movie to disk. The 
        default is 'ffpyplayer'.

    The audio track should be exactly the same length as the video track.

    Parameters
    ----------
    outputFile : str
        Path to the output video file where audio and video will be merged.
    videoFile : str
        Path to the input video file.
    audioFile : str or None
        Path to the audio file to add to the video file.

        The name of the audio codec to use. This should be a valid codec name
        for the encoder library being used. If `None`, the default codec for
        the encoder library will be used.
    useThreads : bool
        If `True`, the audio will be added in a separate thread. This allows the
        audio to be added in the background while the program continues to run.
        If `False`, the audio will be added in the main thread and the program
        will block until the audio is added. Defaults to `True`.
    removeFiles : bool
        If `True`, the input video (`videoFile`) and audio (`audioFile`) files 
        will be removed (i.e. deleted from disk) after the audio has been added 
        to the video. Defaults to `False`.
    writerOpts : dict or None
        Options to pass to the movie writer. This should be a dictionary of
        keyword arguments to pass to the movie writer. If `None`, the default
        options for the movie writer will be used. Defaults to `None`. See
